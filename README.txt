Command Line Tool
We've built a CLI (Command Line Interface) which is supported by OSX, Linux and Windows. To create your own resume, install resume-cli from npm:

npm install -g resume-cli

Exporting
The command line tool uses an ecosystem of modules that we've open sourced to convert your resume to different formats:

resume export resume.pdf
resume export resume.html
